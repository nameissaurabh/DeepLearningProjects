### Deep Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the Deep Learning Projects Repository, a collection of deep learning projects I have worked on in the past using TensorFlow and PyTorch. This repository features implementations ranging from foundational neural networks to advanced applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and more. While these projects were developed some time ago, they reflect my foundational journey in machine learning and cover a variety of use cases and techniques. By uploading them now to GitHub, I aim to document and share these efforts for learning, collaboration, and reference.

#### This repository contains a wide range of deep learning projects for:

- Explore foundational and advanced concepts in deep learning.
- Apply state-of-the-art techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Compare and contrast TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations for various tasks.
- Each project is structured to be beginner-friendly while offering scope for advanced exploration.

#### Tools and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: Pytorch, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
